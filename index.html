<b>ANCHOR 1:</b> We begin with our top story. Environmental advocates across the country are raising their voices following the alarming “oxygen crisis” that’s now making headlines worldwide. For more details, we go live to our field correspondent.<br> 
<b>ANCHOR 3:</b> Here’s Gonzales, live on the ground.<br>
<b>REPORTER 1:</b> Thank you, DAYONDON. I’m reporting live from the Cebu City Central Park, where hundreds of students, local residents, and environmental groups have gathered today to demand urgent action from the government. Protesters are calling for stricter environmental regulations and immediate reforestation efforts, following recent reports of declining air quality across major urban areas. Many participants are carrying banners saying “Save Our Air” and “No Trees, No Life.” Local police say the rally has remained peaceful so far, with proper coordination between organizers and authorities. This is Oliver Gonzales, Back to you in the Peak studio.<br> 
<b>ANCHOR 2:</b> Thank you, Gonzales. Truly, this growing environmental concern shows how deeply people care about our planet’s future. Now, to understand how this crisis began and what experts are saying, here’s Kyle Delima with the full headline story.<br>
<b>REPORTER 2:</b> Thank you, Canape. According to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the so-called “oxygen crisis” refers to the rising levels of air pollution and deforestation leading to reduced oxygen production from our forests. Experts warn that if left unaddressed, the crisis could worsen respiratory illnesses and impact climate stability. Environmentalists emphasize that industrial emissions, vehicle smoke, and illegal logging are among the primary causes. In response, lawmakers are now pushing for a new “Clean Air and Green Future Act,” which aims to increase reforestation programs and limit factory emissions nationwide. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has also released a statement urging collaboration between government and citizens to protect the environment. This is Kyle Delima, keeping you informed on the ongoing Peak field situation. Back to you, anchors.<br> 
<b>ANCHOR 1:</b> Thank you, Delima for that in-depth report. Truly, the oxygen crisis reminds us all how important it is to take care of our natural resources.<br>
